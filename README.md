# Alone Once Again

Violet is a high school senior on the precipice of graduation. Having had an unstable childhood, she has grown dependent on her friends and parents for emotional support. However, now she has college to contend with, and the unfamiliarity that will bring. New location, no friends. As she walks home from school, she ruminates on how sheâ€™ll contend with these new changes, when suddenly, the world shifts, and she finds herself in an empty world devoid of life (seemingly). With ruined neighborhoods, abandoned buildings, and desolate parks as far as the eye can see, Violet begins to feel the horror of loneliness. Striving to escape being alone once again, she makes her way through this Abysmal world. But is she really alone?

## Gameplay
